\section*{Methods}
A total of \num{7232} files chromatogram files from two sets of replicate samples, two 
each for needle and cambium were processed using an iPython notebook and various 
utilities.  The chromatograms were processed using phred v.020425 into FASTA 
sequences with a trimming cutoff of 0.01 and sequences which were less than 
100 bases long were excluded.  The ESTs were combined into single files 
according to sample name (e.g., P32C, P32N, P40C, P40N).  Each of these combined 
files were processed using SeqClean, screening both for vectors using the 
UniVec database and contamination from \textit{E. coli} K-12 substr.\ DH10B.  The 
cleaned and trimmed ESTs were assembled into unigenes using iAssembler v.1.3.2.

The unigene sets were individually aligned, using an iPlant Collaborative 
atmosophere instance, to the NCBI nr database using BLAST+ 
2.2.29, keeping a maximum of 10 high-scoring segment pairs (HSP) per unigene, 
with a minimum e-value of \num{1e-5}.
