    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The enormous amount of sequence data
                  available in the public domain database has been a
                  gold mine for researchers exploring various themes
                  in life sciences, and hence the quality of such data
                  is of serious concern to researchers. Removal of
                  vector contamination is one of the most significant
                  operations to obtain accurate sequence data
                  containing only a {cDNA} insert from the basecalls
                  output by an automatic {DNA} sequencer. Popular
                  bioinformatics programs to accomplish vector
                  trimming include {LUCY}, cross\_match and
                  {SeqClean}.{RESULTS}:In a recent study, where the
                  program {SeqClean} was used to remove vector
                  contamination from our test set of {EST} data
                  compiled through various library construction
                  systems, however, a significant number of errors
                  remained after preliminary trimming. These errors
                  were later almost completely corrected by simply
                  using a re-linearized form of the cloning vector to
                  compare against the target {ESTs}. The modified
                  trimming procedure for {SeqClean} was also compared
                  with the trimming efficiency of the other two
                  popular programs, {LUCY2}, and cross\_match. Using
                  {SeqClean} with a re-linearized form of the cloning
                  vector significantly surpassed the other two
                  programs in all tested conditions, while the
                  performance of the other two programs was not
                  influenced by the modified procedure. Vector
                  contamination in {dbEST} was also investigated in
                  this study: 2203 out of the 48212 {ESTs} sampled
                  from {dbEST} (2007-04-18 freeze) were found to match
                  sequences in {UNIVEC}.{CONCLUSION}:Vector
                  contamination remains a serious concern to the data
                  quality in the public sequence database
                  nowadays. Based on the results presented here, we
                  feel that our modified procedure with {SeqClean}
                  should be recommended to all researchers for the
                  task of vector removal from {EST} or genomic
                  sequences.},

    abstract = {The {BLAST} programs are widely used tools for
                  searching protein and {DNA} databases for sequence
                  similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of
                  definitional, algorithmic and statistical
                  refinements described here permits the execution
                  time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased
                  substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to
                  weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering
                  the extension of word hits, combined with a new
                  heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a
                  gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately
                  three times the speed of the original. In addition,
                  a method is introduced for automatically combining
                  statistically significant alignments produced by
                  {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and
                  searching the database using this matrix. The
                  resulting {Position-Specific} Iterated {BLAST}
                  ({PSI}-{BLAST}) program runs at approximately the
                  same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in
                  many cases is much more sensitive to weak but
                  biologically relevant sequence
                  similarities. {PSI}-{BLAST} is used to uncover

                Functional genomics technologies have been widely
                  adopted in the biological research of both model and
                  non-model species. An efficient functional
                  annotation of {DNA} or protein sequences is a major
                  requirement for the successful application of these
                  approaches as functional information on gene
                  products is often the key to the interpretation of
                  experimental results. Therefore, there is an
                  increasing need for bioinformatics resources which
                  are able to cope with large amount of sequence data,
                  produce valuable annotation results and are easily
                  accessible to laboratories where functional genomics
                  projects are being undertaken. We present the
                  {Blast2GO} suite as an integrated and
                  biologist-oriented solution for the high-throughput
                  and automatic functional annotation of {DNA} or
                  protein sequences based on the Gene Ontology
                  vocabulary. The most outstanding {Blast2GO} features
                  are: (i) the combination of various annotation
                  strategies and tools controlling type and intensity
                  of annotation, (ii) the numerous graphical features
                  such as the interactive {GO}-graph visualization for
                  gene-set function profiling or descriptive charts,
                  (iii) the general sequence management features and
                  (iv) high-throughput capabilities. We used the
                  {Blast2GO} framework to carry out a detailed
                  analysis of annotation behaviour through homology
                  transfer and its impact in functional genomics
                  research. Our aim is to offer biologists useful
                  information to take into account when addressing the
                  task of functionally characterizing their sequence
                  data.

                {KEGG} (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a
                  knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene
                  functions, linking genomic information with higher
                  order functional information. The genomic
                  information is stored in the {GENES} database, which
                  is a collection of gene catalogs for all the
                  completely sequenced genomes and some partial
                  genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene
                  functions. The higher order functional information
                  is stored in the {PATHWAY} database, which contains
                  graphical representations of cellular processes,
                  such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal
                  transduction and cell cycle. The {PATHWAY} database
                  is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables
                  for the information about conserved subpathways
                  (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by
                  positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and
                  which are especially useful in predicting gene
                  functions. A third database in {KEGG} is {LIGAND}
                  for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme
                  molecules and enzymatic reactions. {KEGG} provides
                  Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps,
                  comparing two genome maps and manipulating
                  expression maps, as well as computational tools for
                  sequence comparison, graph comparison and path
                  computation. The {KEGG} databases are daily updated
                  and made freely available

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.
RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95\% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene.
CONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive}
