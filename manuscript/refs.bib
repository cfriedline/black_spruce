    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The enormous amount of sequence data available in the public domain database has been a gold mine for researchers exploring various themes in life sciences, and hence the quality of such data is of serious concern to researchers. Removal of vector contamination is one of the most significant operations to obtain accurate sequence data containing only a {cDNA} insert from the basecalls output by an automatic {DNA} sequencer. Popular bioinformatics programs to accomplish vector trimming include {LUCY}, cross\_match and {SeqClean}.{RESULTS}:In a recent study, where the program {SeqClean} was used to remove vector contamination from our test set of {EST} data compiled through various library construction systems, however, a significant number of errors remained after preliminary trimming. These errors were later almost completely corrected by simply using a re-linearized form of the cloning vector to compare against the target {ESTs}. The modified trimming procedure for {SeqClean} was also compared with the trimming efficiency of the other two popular programs, {LUCY2}, and cross\_match. Using {SeqClean} with a re-linearized form of the cloning vector significantly surpassed the other two programs in all tested conditions, while the performance of the other two programs was not influenced by the modified procedure. Vector contamination in {dbEST} was also investigated in this study: 2203 out of the 48212 {ESTs} sampled from {dbEST} (2007-04-18 freeze) were found to match sequences in {UNIVEC}.{CONCLUSION}:Vector contamination remains a serious concern to the data quality in the public sequence database nowadays. Based on the results presented here, we feel that our modified procedure with {SeqClean} should be recommended to all researchers for the task of vector removal from {EST} or genomic sequences.},

    abstract = {The {BLAST} programs are widely used tools for searching protein and {DNA} databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting {Position-Specific} Iterated {BLAST} ({PSI}-{BLAST}) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI}-{BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

                Functional genomics technologies have been widely adopted in the biological research of both model and non-model species. An efficient functional annotation of {DNA} or protein sequences is a major requirement for the successful application of these approaches as functional information on gene products is often the key to the interpretation of experimental results. Therefore, there is an increasing need for bioinformatics resources which are able to cope with large amount of sequence data, produce valuable annotation results and are easily accessible to laboratories where functional genomics projects are being undertaken. We present the {Blast2GO} suite as an integrated and biologist-oriented solution for the high-throughput and automatic functional annotation of {DNA} or protein sequences based on the Gene Ontology vocabulary. The most outstanding {Blast2GO} features are: (i) the combination of various annotation strategies and tools controlling type and intensity of annotation, (ii) the numerous graphical features such as the interactive {GO}-graph visualization for gene-set function profiling or descriptive charts, (iii) the general sequence management features and (iv) high-throughput capabilities. We used the {Blast2GO} framework to carry out a detailed analysis of annotation behaviour through homology transfer and its impact in functional genomics research. Our aim is to offer biologists useful information to take into account when addressing the task of functionally characterizing their sequence data.

                {KEGG} (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the {GENES} database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the {PATHWAY} database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The {PATHWAY} database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in {KEGG} is {LIGAND} for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. {KEGG} provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The {KEGG} databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).
