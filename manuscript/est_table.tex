\caption{EST summary information. Reads are the number of ESTs that 
    were combined pre-assembly out of the total, following filtering and 
    cleaning; assembled reads are the numbers of reads from each library 
    present in the resulting assembly along with the distribution of their 
    lengths; BLASTX hits are the filtered hits per library of the assembled 
    unigene against nr meeting the filtering parameters of query percentage, 
    query identity, and taxonomic division.}
